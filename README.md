**MY LEARNING NOTES**
Partitioning: Carving out space in the SSD without nuking my Windows data. (Terrifying the first time!)

The Live USB: Using tools like Rufus or BalenaEtcher to create a "portal" into Linux.

BIOS/UEFI Tweaks: Disabling Secure Boot and Fast Boot—the "gatekeepers" that try to keep you on Windows.

Challenges Faced 

The Bootloader Battle: Occasionally, Windows Updates decide they own the house and "hide" the Linux Grub menu. Learning to repair the bootloader was my first "real" Linux lesson.

Driver Drama: My Wi-Fi card didn't work out of the box. I had to learn how to tether my phone's internet to download the proprietary drivers. It felt like MacGyver-ing my laptop.

The "Case-Sensitive" Trap: Coming from Windows, I didn't realize Folder and folder were different things. I spent 20 minutes looking for a file that was right in front of me.

Permissions (sudo): Getting "Permission Denied" errors until I realized that in Linux, you have to explicitly ask for "God Mode" (sudo) to do anything important.
